				<u><h1>The World of Animation</h1></u>
                
<p>  Sure, let me give you a brief overview of the history of animation. Basically, animation is the process of manipulating still images quickly to give the impression of motion. It began in the early 1800s with the creation of the first animated film, "The Flying Scissors," by French artist Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot. However, the first animated short film to be used for commercial purposes was "The Toy Shop," made in 1898 by Edwin S. Porter. During the 1920s, animation started to gain traction in the US with the production of several animated short films, such as "The Walt Disney's Alice Comedies" series (1923–1927) and "Steamboat Willie," which debuted in 1928 and was the first animated film to feature sound. Animation technology continued to advance through the creation of these films.I.e.
 In 1937, Disney's breakthrough motion picture, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," marked the beginning of the company's triumph in the motion picture business. Animation technology advanced further during the 1930s and 1940s. The emergence of computer-generated animation, stop-motion animation, and other types of animation has led to the continuous evolution and advancement of animation techniques over time.
 Film, television, advertisements, and video games are just a few of the media that use animation today. It is a global industry. Stories, communication, and artistic expression can all be effectively conveyed through the art genre.Basically, animation is the process of manipulating still images quickly to give the impression of motion.
